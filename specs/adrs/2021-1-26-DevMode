# Create Dev Mode to Test and View Features

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-1-26]

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to be able to run tests and view features that may be hidden from or unavailable to users in able to have full access to our product. How can we implement this in a manner that doesn't compromise the security and integrity of our product?

## Considered Options

* Have all features open to users, only hide tests
* Have features that can be hidden/locked, but use careful tests to access them
* Developer mode, inaccessible to users with full permissions to view features and tests

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 1, because we did not encounter the need for hidden features.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Open features, tests only

* Good, because it's simple to implement
* Bad, because it limits our design decisions

### Flexible feature design, tests only

* Good, because it allows us to design features freely
* Bad, because we may encounter issues with testing features that are locked at certain times
* Bad, because it forces developers to follow use diagrams to access features

### Developer mode

* Good, because it allows developers and QA full access to product, including locked features
* Good, because it allows for a variety of feature designs
* Bad, because it creates potential security issues (if users gain access)
* Bad, because it diverges from use diagrams (may affect how developers see UX/UI)
