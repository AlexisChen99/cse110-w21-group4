# Language Inclusivity

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-2-31]

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a product that is usable by people all over the world. How can we make our product more accessible?

## Considered Options

* Add multiple languages and translate our instructions/text
* Make our text translate-accesible by browsers

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 1, adding multiple languages, because we have the bandwidth and ability to implement several common languages. 

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Translation

* Good, because we can specifically determine the translation and moderate its accuracy
* Good, because there is no real delay and the user can easily select amongst the offered languages
* Bad, because we are limited by our knowledge of languages

### Browser Translation

* Good, because it allows the user to translate to any language offered by the browser
* Good, because it utilizes an interface (through the browser) that they are likely comfortable with
* Bad, because certain terms may be mistranslated/inaccurate
* Bad, because not all browsers offer equivalent translation services
