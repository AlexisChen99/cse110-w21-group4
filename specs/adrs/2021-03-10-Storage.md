# Storage Options

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [backend decision]
* Date: [2021-03-10]

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we store persistent user data so that they don't have to keep inputting their preferences/tasks across sessions?

## Considered Options

* Arrays (in code)
* LocalStorage

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 2, LocalStorage, because this is more reliable option to preserve settings across sessions.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Arrays

* Good, because it is quick and easy to add/change/access data
* Good, because we can store multiple datatypes (including numbers)
* Bad, because it doesn't persist across sessions

### LocalStorage

* Good, because it preserves data across user sessions (in browser)
* Bad, because we have to convert all data to Strings
