# Notifications

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-03-10]

## Context and Problem Statement

How should we alert the user to changes to their tasklist?

## Considered Options

* Visual changes
* Notification/Alert

## Decision Outcome

Chose to implement both for maximum clarity.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Visual Changes

* Good, because it is not disruptive
* Bad, because it does not draw attention to potential unintended changes

### Notification/Alert

* Good, because it specifically alerts user of changes or possible mistakes
* Good, because it is not overall disruptive
* Bad, because it can be distracting/takes up more space on the screen
