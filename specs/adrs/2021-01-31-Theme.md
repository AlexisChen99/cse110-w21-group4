# Product design layout/ideology

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [froend-end developer decision]
* Date: [2021-1-31]

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a consistent design plan in place to structure our UI around. What sort of design ideology should we keep in mind while developing our front end?

## Considered Options

* Minimalism -- very simple layout, minimal features/images
* Themed -- play with animations, images, colors, etc

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 1, minimalism, at first--later added several simple themes for users to pick from.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Minimalism

* Good, because it is simple, functional, and ideally intuitive for the user
* Good, because it prevents distractions for the user
* Good, because it embodies our purpose of being productive and efficient
* Bad, because it can be boring or unattractive
* Bad, because it can emphasize flaws (nothing to hide behind)

### Creative design

* Good, because it is exciting, attractive, and engaging
* Good, because an appealing design can encourage users to return or even share our product with others
* Good, because it can be used to show our team's personality and ideology through creativity
* Good, because themes and designs give us more to work on/with
* Bad, because themes can divide the audience (appealing to some but not to others)
* Bad, because design requires experience and significant time to see returns
* Bad, because design can distract the team and the user from the actual purpose of the product
* Bad, because poor design can complicate the user story or how we implement our features
