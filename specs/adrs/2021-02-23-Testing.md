# Testing Mechanisms

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [QA decision]
* Date: [2021-02-23]

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to have a manageable and thorough system of tests in place to verify our code functionality. How can we set up tests so this is possible?

## Considered Options

* Jest -- JavaScript unit tests, verifies specific functionality
* Mocha -- JavaScript unit tests
* Cypress -- Javascript end-to-end tests, verifies user actions are processed as expected

## Decision Outcome

Chose options 1 and 3 to have both unit tests and e2e testing. 

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Jest

* Good, because QA dev has prior experience
* Good, because there is minimal configuration required for basic functionality
* Bad, because it is "younger" and has less documentation

### Mocha

* Good, because it has a precedent of being reliable and flexible
* Good, because it provides both front- and back-end testing functionality
* Bad, because it requires more setup, libraries, etc.

### Cypress

* Good, because e2e testing is required for our code (significant DOM manipulation)
* Good, because basic setup has already been covered by class
* Bad, because it can't be run in the workflow
* Bad, because it is difficult to set up coverage reports
