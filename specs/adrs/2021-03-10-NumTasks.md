## Context and Problem Statement

How many tasks should we have "pinned" to the main page to maximize UI and UX?

## Considered Options

* 3 tasks
* 1 task

## Decision Outcome

Chose to pin one task, to decrease clutter on the screen while also keeping the user focused on their current task.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 3 Tasks

* Good, because it allowed the user to keep upcoming tasks in mind
* Good, because it allows the user to quickly choose which task they want to work on
* Bad, because it takes up significant space on the page
* Bad, because the user may not commit to a set order/series of tasks and be distracted by the various tasks they want to complete

### 1 Task

* Good, because it emphasizes the current task on the page
* Good, because it reduces clutter and the potential for distraction
* Bad, because the user has to open the task menu to check which tasks they have added or want to change
