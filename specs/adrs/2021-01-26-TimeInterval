# Deciding time interval for timer

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-1-26]

## Context and Problem Statement

How should the time intervals for our pomodoro timer be decided? Should the user have input?

## Considered Options

* Hard-code specific (widely accepted) time intervals
* Suggest time intervals, but allow users to make changes
* Choose specific (widely accepted) time intervals for MVP, but leave possibilty for user changes (code around option 2)

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 3, coding around the possibility for user changes in the future, because we want to produce a complete MVP ASAP, but user input may be a feature we want to implement down the line.

### Positive Consequences

* N/A (yet)
* …

### Negative Consequences 

* N/A (yet)
* …

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Hard-coded

* Good, because it's simple to implement
* Bad, because it limits user input and prevents a potentially desired feature

### User input

* Good, because it gives users the freedom to cater to their needs/wants
* Bad, because it takes longer to code/test
* Bad, because it is an extraneous feature at the moment

### Flexible coding

* Good, because it allows us to code simply (with forethought) and more quickly
* Good, because it allows us the freedom to add a feature later on with minimal issues
* Bad, because it is more difficult and time-consuming than hard-coding
* Bad, because we may not benefit from this time investment down the line
