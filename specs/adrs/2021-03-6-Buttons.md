# Button Layout/Function

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: [team decision]
* Date: [2021-3-6]

## Context and Problem Statement

What kind of buttons and button functions should we have to embody the spirit of the pomo timer?

## Considered Options

* Start, Stop (with Pause functionality), and Reset
* Start, Stop (with Reset functionality)

## Decision Outcome

Chose option 2, Start and Stop, because having a Stop button with Pause functionality seems to run counter to the spirit of a pomo timer.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Start, Stop, Reset

* Good, because it adds an additional option for the user
* Bad, because it provides the opportunity for the user to be distracted from their work/take an unscheduled break
* Bad, because it is mandatory to use the Stop button to use the Reset button (in current implementation, i.e. not truly an option)

### Start, Stop

* Good, because it disincentivizes the user to restart their timer unnecessarily
* Good, because it declutters the screen
* Bad, because places restrictions on the user that they might find uncomfortable/undesireable
