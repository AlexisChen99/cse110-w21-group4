> I donâ€™t have a mouse and my trackpad doesnâ€™t work sometimes. Usually I have to press tab in order to navigate to the button I want to select then press enter, so I hope there is accessibility to press the start/stop button this way. Also, I have to use the arrow keys in order to scroll the page if there is any information about how to use the timer at the bottom.

> - My children love to watch the potatoes grow on the timer when they do their homework. They keep track of how many potatoes they harvested on a piece of paper, but I think it would be better for them to stay focused on their homework while they can use an account to keep track of the potato harvest count.
