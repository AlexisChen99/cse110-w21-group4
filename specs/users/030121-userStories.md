> I am R-G colorblind, so I am unable to distinguish between the color red and green. It wouldn’t be helpful to determine if it is working or break time if I can’t tell if the background is day or night. The website might also look weird due to my colorblindness.

> - I am completely colorblind. I am better off using a plain timer because I wouldn’t be able to see the farm theme. If there are gradients to the sky and fields, I’d be able to appreciate what Potato Tech LLC has created. In addition, I think a textual indicator of if it is work or break time should be noticeable to accommodate my needs.
