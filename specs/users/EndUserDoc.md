## What is PotatoTimer?

PotatoTimer is tool that combines the pomo technique and potato theme to help users concentrate on their tasks and enhance their performance. The original pomo technique involves estimating the time to complete certain tasks, working on the tasks, tracking users' distraction, and reflecting on the performance of the day. Our product mainly focuses on the completion of tasks and reflection of performance. Unlike other timer tools that also use the pomo technique, we incorproate some potato vibe and features to create a sense of playfulness in our product to make working more fun and less boring.

## How to user PotatoTimer?

  ### How to Start
  
  To use our product, users just need to click on the [link](https://alexischen99.github.io/cse110-w21-group4/source/potato.html) without installing anything.

If users want to read the introduction in differernt languages other than English, they could go to `setting` -> `language` to change the language of the page.

   Before adding tasks and starting the timer, users could go on to `Setting` which is the gear icon in the top right corner to customize their timer. For `Select a Theme`, users could choose the minimalist light and dar themes or the potato theme that make your work fun. In the potato themes, upon the completion of one work stage, users would see one additional dancing potato on the screen to celebrate users' hard work.
