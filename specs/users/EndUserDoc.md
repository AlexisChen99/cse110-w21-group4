## What is PotatoTimer?

PotatoTimer is tool that combines the pomo technique and potato theme to help users concentrate on their tasks and enhance their performance. The original pomo technique involves estimating the time to complete certain tasks, working on the tasks, tracking users' distraction, and reflecting on the performance of the day. Our product mainly focuses on the completion of tasks and reflection of performance. Unlike other timer tools that also use the pomo technique, we incorproate some potato vibe and features to create a sense of playfulness in our product to make working more fun and less boring.

## How to user PotatoTimer?

  ### How to Start

  ### Instruction
  
  For first time users, we prodvide the Instruction Menu to help them become familiar with our product and the pomo technique.

  ### Setting 
  
  Before adding tasks and starting the timer, users could go on to `Setting` which is the gear icon in the top right corner to customize their timer. For `Select a Theme`, users could choose the minimalist light and dar themes or the potato theme that make your work fun. In the potato themes, upon the completion of one work stage, users would see one additional dancing potato on the screen to celebrate users' hard work. If users find the potato dancing too distracting, they could click on the `Disable Potato Animation` to stop the potato from dancing and click on the `Enable Potato Animation` to enable to animation.<br/>
  For the length of each stage, users could adjust the time in `Work Time`, `Short Break`, and `Long Break` to customize the time for each stage. Fro the three stages, the first bar indicates minutes whereas the second bar indicates seconds. Below the three stages, is `Volume`, which users could adjust to change the volume of the beep. User could also click on the voulme icon to mute the beep so that when the time is up, users would not hear the soud.<br/>
  On the bottom of the `Settings`, there are currently four choices of language– English, Spanish, Chinese, and Korean. When user click on one language, the website would close the Setting menu and redirect you to the main page of our website.

  ### Adding and Editing Tasks
  
  Before starting the timer, users could type the tasks they wish to accomplish into the white `Enter a Task To Start` bar located in the center of the page. Then, users could hit `Enter` or the `Add` button next to the enter bar to enter theur task. Once users enter a task, the task would show up in the center of the main page.<br/> Furthermore, a text would appear beneath the `Start` button to notify that users have entered a task. The first task users input would show up on the main page. When users enter more tasks, those tasks would be in `Tasks`. Users could go to `Tasks` to view their entire task list. Users could click on the `circle` on far left to mark a task as done, the `red pin` to pin the task to the main page, or the `X` button on the far right to delete a task from the task list. Furthermore, users could click on `delete all` in the task menu to delete all tasks. By default, our product only displays one task in the main page. If users want to see more tasks, they could click the `red pin` to have the task show up in the maing page. After users refresh or come back to the page, the tasks user entered would still be in the `Tasks`.

  ### Start
  
  After entering tasks, users could press the `start` button to start the timer. Once users press the button, the timer would start running and the word above the timer would dispaly the current stage– work, short break, or long break. Furthermore, the setting icons, question mark on the top right corner, and the task promp would disappear to help users focus on completing their tasks. If users want to enter more task or adjust setting during work stage, they could hover around to see the task prompt and setting icons. The three items mentioned above would reappear when the timer goes into short break or long break. Then, users could enter more tasks or edit their tasks. In the potato theme, when one work stage is completed, a dancing potato would show up to indicate the completion of one stage. Furthermore, the background would change from day time to night time to encourage users to take a break and rest. When a short break or long break ends, the background would switch back to the day time.

  ### Stop
  
  We understand that unexpected things may come up for users after they start the timer. In case users are not able to continue working on their task, they could press the `Stop` button to terminate the timer. After users click on `Confirm` for the prompt, the timer would reset the time and stage would become Idle.

  ### End and Reflection
  
  Unlike the original pomo technique, Potatotimer does not prompt users to estimate the time for each task. Instead, the timer would keep running until users finish all tasks by marking each task as done. After users start the timer and finish all tasks, one screen would appear to congrate and inform user how many "pomotatoes", which means work stages, it to them to finish their tasks. Users could click anywhere outside of the congratulation screen to return to the main page. Once users return to the page, all tasks would be deleted and users could enter more tasks to start working again or stop.

  ### Accesibility 
  
  In case users are not able to use their mouse, PotatoTimer allows users to navigate the entire page using only `tab` and `enter` or `space bar`. When users navigate around task using tab, they could press `skip` button to go to the next task, which saves them time to navigate through `circle`, `pin`, and `delete` for the task.
