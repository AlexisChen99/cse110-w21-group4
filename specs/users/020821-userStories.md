> My eyes are photosensitive to bright lights, so I avoid pages that have a really bright color scheme. I use low brightness and dark themes, so I wouldn’t be able to enjoy that daytime aspect of the farm if it is too strong on my eyes.

> I’ve used wristwatches for chest days, but I’m looking for something that won’t strain my neck and sore arms for leg days. I know how to operate a timer, but I’d like the time to be large enough for me to look at on a phone/tablet on the treadmill. I hope those potatoes look delicious to get me hungry for my afternoon meal.

> As a software engineer, I have to use a timer while coding. Otherwise, nonstop work will burn me out by the end of the week. I’d like a fully-functional pomo timer that has a start and stop button with a longer break after the fourth interval. Since work changes project-to-project, I’d like to customize the time.

> I am a mom with two infants that are really responsive to sound when they sleep. I don’t want to disturb them as I work at home, but a pomodoro timer is too noisy. I’d like this internet timer to be able to be muted on Safari. I still have to have my volume on my phone for work calls, so I’d appreciate if there was an option on the webpage to mute.
