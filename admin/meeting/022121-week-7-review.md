# Agenda
1. Backend
2. Frontend and UI
3. QA Unit Testing

# Notes
- Backend: use potato icons to denote number of intervals in a pomodoro cycle.
- Find code to implement the background image so it doesn't scale and it crops/cuts off to the viewport width.
- Have a list of tasks and a way to display the top three tasks.
- The CI/CD pipeline now reacts to pull requests.
  - Doesn't pass the linting process or doc generation.
  - Tests work
- Unsure if tests should be written for main or other front/backend branches
  - Resolved: will update tasks as the dev teams merge to main.
  - As long as the functionality is noted, the unit testing would be matched accordingly.
- First Sprint Review is due Tuesday 2/23.
