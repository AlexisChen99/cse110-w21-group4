## Discuss
- Most of the votes were on the friendship among the team.
- Productivity should've been much faster. Add one more person to the frontend and make it a focus.
- Too much work in labs and review quizzes.
- Visual design seems like a lot for this type of class. There's a separate major for it.
- Mad that the task feature wasn't 100% laid out.
- Mad meeting for group projects because it's annoying balancing this with other classes.
- Hard to reach consensus on design and process.
- The three themes look really nice.
- Each team made good progress with their parts.
- The management process (assignments, GH Issues and Projects) were done great.
