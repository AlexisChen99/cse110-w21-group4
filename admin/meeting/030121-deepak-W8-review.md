# Agenda
1. Showcase the timer

# Notes
- Flexbox the buttons and tasks.
  - Pin and delete markers should be to the right of the task name.
  - Drag icon should only display over the draggable header in the settings menu.
- ARIA role for accessiblity on image onclick events.
- Can make the settings menu parts even 20% smaller.
- Important!!! Focus on fixing margins and padding, otherwise the timer looks shoddy and half-baked.
