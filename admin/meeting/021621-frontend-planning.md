# Agenda
1. Frontend and UI Designing

# Notes
- Explained how to implement the HTML elements for each part of the UI.
- Use stock images for the potato theme (cite sources and check usage rights).
- Rearranged the UI layouts by team consensus.
- Decided to display only the top 5 or so tasks on the main display with a dropdown/menu button that displays the entire task list.
- (Potato) Changed the timer display into a circular shape to emulate a sun design.
- (Dark) Change the timer display into a moon (partial or full?) design
- Four? static images of potato growth to show changes in intervals.
- The light and dark modes are currently fine for colorblind accessibility.
- Remove the skip button. Comment out this code.
- Put the options menu somewhere in the middle near the timer.
- Decrease the phase (work/idle) font.
- Add the "Potato Timer" title to the top of the page.
- TODO: Frontend creates the two showable menus and attaches the options elements onto the menus. Add the images on top of default backgrounds.
