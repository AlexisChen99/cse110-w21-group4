Marco Kuan: What did we do today?

Marco Kuan: Meeting with group :smile:

Kevin Jang: I figured out how to solve the 130 problem xD
(sooo not ready for midterm tomorrow)

Marco Kuan: Is CSE 130 hard?

Kevin Jang: It is hard defining functions because there are a lot of steps to do it the "correct" way
I think it would be easier using the Haskell IDE but my computer can't support it so I'm kinda doing the hw blind

Marco Kuan: Oh rip :disappointed:. good luck on it :open_mouth:.

Jessie Zou: Nothing

Alexis Chen: nothing

Miaoqiu Sun: Nothing

Rohan Patel: Nothing
