Marco Kuan: What have we done today team? :slightly_smiling_face:

Alexis Chen: Lol, havenâ€™t done anything today. Plan to work on personas later today

Marco Kuan: Same, I'm working with Rohan, right now

Rohan Patel: I pushed a basic pomo-timer to the repo (no html or css) and just the bare minimum js functions. Working on the systems diagrams now

Marco Kuan: @Rohan Patel and I have pushed an update where we added javadocs to the app.js and we updated the C4 diagram.

Kevin Jang: Keep the diagrams coming for the pitch writeup xD

Jessie Zou: Nothin
